# cryptorequest
This python script pulls the current name and prices of all cryptocurrencies traded on Coinbase.com and compiles them into a list. I began writing this in an attempt to learn some of the basic functions behind the beautifulsoup4 library. In the end I learned more about string manipulation and some list manipulation techniques using for loops.
